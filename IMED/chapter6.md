# Short Notes on Key Business and Taxation Terms

---

## 1. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

- EOQ is the optimal order quantity that minimizes the total inventory costs.
- It balances ordering costs (cost to place an order) and holding costs (cost to store inventory).
- Helps businesses decide how much stock to order to avoid overstocking or stockouts.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
  \]  
  Where:  
  - \(D\) = Demand (units/year)  
  - \(S\) = Ordering cost per order  
  - \(H\) = Holding cost per unit per year

---

## 2. Income Tax

- Income Tax is a direct tax levied by the government on the income earned by individuals, companies, and other entities.
- It is usually progressive, meaning tax rates increase with higher income levels.
- Used by governments to generate revenue for public services and infrastructure.
- Taxpayers must file income tax returns declaring their income and pay tax accordingly.

---

## 3. Goods and Services Tax (GST)

- GST is a comprehensive indirect tax levied on the manufacture, sale, and consumption of goods and services.
- It replaced many indirect taxes like VAT, service tax, and excise duty to create a unified tax structure.
- GST is destination-based and collected at every stage of the supply chain.
- Divided into:  
  - CGST (Central GST)  
  - SGST (State GST)  
  - IGST (Integrated GST) for interstate transactions

---

## 4. Value Added Tax (VAT)

- VAT is an indirect tax on the value added to goods and services at each stage of production or distribution.
- Charged on the difference between the cost of inputs and the price of outputs.
- Businesses collect VAT from customers and remit it to the government.
- VAT is a multi-stage tax and avoids the cascading effect of taxes.

---

## 5. Sales Tax

- Sales Tax is a tax imposed on the sale of goods and sometimes services.
- It is usually charged as a percentage of the sale price.
- Collected by the seller from the buyer and paid to the government.
- Replaced or subsumed by GST in many countries to streamline indirect taxation.

---

## 6. Excise Duty

- Excise Duty is a tax on the production or manufacture of goods within a country.
- It is usually levied on specific goods such as alcohol, tobacco, petroleum products, and luxury items.
- Paid by the manufacturer, and its cost is often passed on to consumers.
- Helps regulate production, generate government revenue, and control consumption of certain goods.
