## Introduction

**Authentication** and **authorization** are critical components of application security.

- **Authentication:** _Who are you?_
- **Authorization:** _What are you allowed to do?_

Both processes work together to ensure that only legitimate users can access resources, and only within the boundaries defined by their permissions.

## Authentication

### What is Authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system.  
It typically occurs when a user provides credentials (like a username and password) to prove their identity.

### Common Authentication Methods

- **Username and Password:**  
    The most widely used method. Should be combined with strong password policies and secure storage (hashing and salting).
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  
    Requires two or more verification factors (e.g., password + OTP, or password + biometric).
- **Social Login (OAuth/OpenID Connect):**  
    Allows users to log in using third-party providers (Google, Facebook, etc.), improving user experience and security.
- **Token-Based Authentication:**  
    Uses tokens (like JWT) to maintain stateless sessions.
- **Biometric Authentication:**  
    Uses unique biological traits (fingerprint, face recognition) for identity verification.

### Best Practices for Authentication

- Use strong, unique passwords and enforce password policies.
- Store passwords securely using hashing (bcrypt, Argon2) and salting.
- Implement MFA wherever possible.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- Limit login attempts and lock accounts after repeated failures.
- Regularly audit and update authentication mechanisms.

### Node.js Authentication Example

Below is a simple Node.js authentication example using Express, bcrypt for password hashing, and express-session for session management.

```js
const express = require('express');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const session = require('express-session');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(session({ secret: 'secret-key', resave: false, saveUninitialized: true }));

// Dummy user (in production, use a database)
const user = { username: 'user1', passwordHash: bcrypt.hashSync('password123', 10) };

// Login route
app.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    if (username === user.username && await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash)) {
        req.session.user = username;
        return res.send('Logged in!');
    }
    res.status(401).send('Invalid credentials');
});

// Middleware to check authentication
function isAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
    if (req.session.user) return next();
    res.status(401).send('Please log in');
}

// Protected route
app.get('/dashboard', isAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to your dashboard!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## Authorization

### What is Authorization?

Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do.  
It defines access levels, permissions, and actions available to each user or system component.

### Authorization Techniques

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
    Assigns permissions based on user roles (e.g., admin, user, guest). Easy to manage and scalable.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**  
    Uses user, resource, and environmental attributes to make dynamic access decisions. Offers fine-grained control.
- **Policy-Based Access Control:**  
    Defines access based on policies that consider multiple attributes and conditions. Flexible and compliance-friendly.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  
    Specifies permissions for individual users or groups for specific resources.

### Best Practices for Authorization

- Apply the principle of least privilegeâ€”grant users only the access they need.
- Separate authentication and authorization logic.
- Regularly review and update roles, permissions, and policies.
- Monitor and log access to sensitive resources.
- Use centralized authorization management for consistency.

### Node.js Authorization Example

Below is a simple role-based authorization example for Node.js/Express:

```js
// Assume user role is stored in session (in production, fetch from DB or JWT)
function authorizeRole(role) {
    return (req, res, next) => {
        const userRole = req.session.role || 'user'; // Example: default to 'user'
        if (userRole === role) return next();
        res.status(403).send('Forbidden: You do not have access to this resource');
    };
}

// Example usage
app.get('/admin', isAuthenticated, authorizeRole('admin'), (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome, admin!');
});
```

## Authentication and Authorization Flows

### Basic Auth Flow

1. **User submits credentials** (username and password).
2. **System verifies credentials.**
3. If valid, **system issues a session or token** for subsequent requests.
4. For each request, the system checks:
     - Is the user authenticated?
     - Is the user authorized to access the requested resource?

### OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow

Widely used for third-party and modern web applications:

1. **User initiates login** via a client application.
2. **Client redirects user to authorization server** with client ID, redirect URI, and requested scopes.
3. **User authenticates** and **grants consent** at the authorization server.
4. **Authorization server redirects user back** to client with an authorization code.
5. **Client exchanges code for access token** (and optionally a refresh token) at the authorization server.
6. **Client uses the access token** to access protected resources on behalf of the user.

*Refresh Token Grant:*  
When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token without user intervention.

### Node.js OAuth2 Example

Below is a simplified Node.js example of handling an OAuth2 callback and exchanging the code for a token using axios:

```js
const axios = require('axios');

app.get('/oauth/callback', async (req, res) => {
    const { code } = req.query;
    try {
        const response = await axios.post('https://your-auth-server.com/oauth/token', {
            grant_type: 'authorization_code',
            client_id: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
            client_secret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
            code,
            redirect_uri: 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI',
        });
        // Save access_token for API calls
        req.session.access_token = response.data.access_token;
        res.send('OAuth login successful!');
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send('OAuth error');
    }
});
```

> **Note:** Replace `your-auth-server.com`, `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `YOUR_REDIRECT_URI` with your actual values.

## Choosing an Auth Solution

- **Simple apps:** Username/password with session or JWT.
- **Enterprise apps:** RBAC or ABAC with centralized identity management.
- **APIs:** OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for delegated access.
- **High-security environments:** MFA, strong password policies, and regular audits.

---

## Security Best Practices

- **Never store passwords in plain text.**
- **Sanitize and validate all user input** to prevent injection attacks.
- **Implement logging and monitoring** for authentication and authorization events.
- **Regularly update dependencies** and patch vulnerabilities.
- **Educate users** about phishing and social engineering attacks.

## Conclusion

Authentication and authorization are foundational to application security.

- **Authentication** verifies identity.
- **Authorization** defines and enforces access rights.

By implementing robust strategies and following best practices, you can protect your applications and users from unauthorized access and data breaches.

# Understanding Salting in the Development Process

**Salting** is a security technique used to protect stored passwords from attacks such as rainbow table and brute-force attacks. When a user creates or updates a password, a random value called a _salt_ is generated and combined with the password before hashing. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their stored password hashes will be different.

### Why Use Salting?

- **Prevents Precomputed Attacks:** Salting makes it impractical for attackers to use precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to reverse hashes.
- **Unique Hashes:** Each password hash is unique, even for identical passwords, due to the random salt.
- **Enhances Security:** If the password database is compromised, attackers cannot easily determine the original passwords.

### How to Implement Salting

1. **Generate a Random Salt:** Use a secure random number generator to create a unique salt for each password.
2. **Combine Salt and Password:** Concatenate or otherwise combine the salt with the user's password.
3. **Hash the Combination:** Use a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) to hash the salted password.
4. **Store Salt and Hash:** Save both the salt and the resulting hash in the database (never store the plain password).

#### Example (Node.js with bcrypt):

```js
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const password = 'userPassword123';
const saltRounds = 10;

// Generate salt and hash password
bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds, (err, salt) => {
    bcrypt.hash(password, salt, (err, hash) => {
        // Store hash and salt in the database
        console.log('Salt:', salt);
        console.log('Hash:', hash);
    });
});
```

### Best Practices

- Always use a unique salt per password.
- Use established libraries (like bcrypt or Argon2) that handle salting internally.
- Never use outdated or insecure hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1) for password storage.

Salting is a fundamental part of secure password management and should be integrated into the authentication process of any application.
