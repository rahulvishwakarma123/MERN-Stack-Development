# Express Middleware Documentation

Express middleware functions are essential building blocks in Express.js applications. Middleware enables you to execute code, modify requests and responses, end request-response cycles, and call the next middleware in the stack. Middleware can be built-in, third-party, or custom, and are executed in the order they are defined in your application.

## What is Middleware?

Middleware functions in Express.js have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle (`next`). Middleware can:

- Execute any code
- Modify the request and response objects
- End the request-response cycle
- Pass control to the next middleware function using `next()`

> **Note:**  
> If a middleware does not end the request-response cycle or call `next()`, the request will hang.

---

## Types of Middleware

- **Application-level middleware:** Bound to an instance of `express()`.
- **Router-level middleware:** Bound to an instance of `express.Router()`.
- **Error-handling middleware:** Defined with four arguments, the first being `err`.
- **Built-in middleware:** Provided by Express itself.
- **Third-party middleware:** Installed via npm and integrated into Express.

---

## Built-in Middleware

Express provides several built-in middleware functions:

| Middleware             | Description                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `express.json()`       | Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.        |
| `express.urlencoded()` | Parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads. |
| `express.static()`     | Serves static files such as images, CSS, and HTML.  |

**Example:**

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

**Example: Using Morgan and CORS**

```js
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

app.use(morgan('dev'));
app.use(cors());
```

## Writing Custom Middleware

A custom middleware function typically has the following signature:

```js
function myMiddleware(req, res, next) {
        // Custom logic here
        next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
}
```

**Example: Logging Middleware**

```js
const myLogger = function (req, res, next) {
        console.log('LOGGED');
        next();
};

app.use(myLogger);
```

---

## Order of Middleware Execution

Middleware is executed in the order it is defined using `app.use()` or as route handlers. The order is critical, as earlier middleware can modify the request and response objects for later middleware or routes.

**Example:**

```js
app.use(middleware1);
app.use(middleware2);
// middleware1 runs before middleware2
```

---

## Error-handling Middleware

Error-handling middleware functions have four arguments: `(err, req, res, next)`. They are used to catch and handle errors in the application.

**Example:**

```js
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
        console.error(err.stack);
        res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
}

app.use(errorHandler);
```

---

## Using Middleware

- **Globally:** `app.use(middlewareFunction)`
- **On specific routes:** `app.use('/route', middlewareFunction)`
- **With routers:** `router.use(middlewareFunction)`

**Example:**

```js
// Global middleware
app.use(myMiddleware);

// Route-specific middleware
app.use('/api', apiMiddleware);

// Router-level middleware
const router = express.Router();
router.use(routerMiddleware);
```
